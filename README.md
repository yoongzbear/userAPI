Database can be accessed using PHPMyAdmin (Wamp or Xampp) by importing the user.sql file into a new database called "accountpy".

1. User enters the username, password, and name. The password must have more than 8 characters and enters the password again as a confirmation.
2. After registering, the user logs in using their username and password.
3. User can then either logout or stay in the session.

Data validation is implemented to ensure user enters the correct information.
